# MPAGS-Python-Submission
 Code created for the MPAGS Coursework by Lizzie Elmer.  This code takes an imput of 3 fits catalogues from UDS observations. It will  restrict the region this data comes from to a subset of the UDS field and  extract the magnitude values for 7 year stacks of data. It then applies a crude correction for variations in seeing across the years before calculating a  measure of variability (median absolute deviation) for each object and plotting  this against the average magnitude of the object. The plot produced is also interactive - if you click on one of the blue crosses it will bring up the light curve of that object.  I have included pngs of the main plot and an example lightcurve.
